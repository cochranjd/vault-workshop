- If she makes a small edit to add cards to a lesson plan, she:
	- will make a linked copy
	- will make her edits
	- will have to update references in other places to point to her new URL
- Numbering can be problematic if a new lesson has to be inserted
	- For example, if there is lesson 1 and lesson 2...9, and you want to insert a new lesson 2, what happens to the other 2-9?
- My thoughts
	- tagging would allow us to be more dynamic in things like numbering
	- customized naming might be something that could provide some benefit
- Having tons of different copies of a lesson plan is difficult for support
- Look at miro board [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI3tXhjA=/) for a layout of how state is managed across copies/customizations
